## Introduction

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, game development, and embedded systems. This crash course aims to provide a solid foundation in C programming, covering basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henurad/C_Crash_Course.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd C_Crash_Course
   ```

## Usage

To compile and run the examples, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc example.c -o example
./example
```

Replace `example.c` with the name of the C file you wish to compile and run.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of C programming:

- [Working with files](./Working_with_files)
- [`printf` arts](./PrintfArts)
- [FileDiscriptors](./FileDiscriptors)

Each module contains examples and exercises to reinforce learning.
